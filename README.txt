This is a Keep Front Post mod of PAYDAY 2
originally from old lua hook mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/15/616187203893400313
This is the BLT type mod

When you install some optic sight to any AR-15 weapon type, both the back aim post/sight (handleguard) and front will disappear
This mod will preserve the front aim post with any optic sight attached in AR-15 weapon type (other than the default iron sight).

The amcar-change-barrel lua is just some extra mod i create
It changes the medium AR barrel to long
Just my stuff
